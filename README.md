<h1>Fleetbotwars</h1>
<p>This project is a product of a team consisting of 2 other individiuals other than myself. The coding done is mainly seperated into 3 parts, but there's a bit of handiwork in every part from everyone. My part was doing the GUI of the game from ground up. Altough the project is not even near close to finish we were satisfied with what we were able to achieve with the other 16 or so courses we were taking besides this one, and the course's point was not to be able to do so. The point was to go through almost every step of a software engineering lifecycle other then evolving and taking care of bug fixes for the client.</p>
<p>The assingment was to create a strategy game with multiplayer capability, if possible, through network connections. Given the time we could not really achieve the multiplayer part, but we have a decent-ish looking half functional game.</p>
